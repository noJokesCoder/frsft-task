                A tech interview can take about an hour. The date and time of

                phase is a great opportunity for you to know about the stack and
                get acquainted with the lead or the team you will be working
                with. You are welcomed to ask any questions you may have about
                the skills and technologies implemented in the project.

                If you are considering multiple vacancies for different
                projects, we can arrange separate technical interviews that will
                focus on the required skills for each individual project.
